# ShimmerEffectAndroid
Shimmer effect was created by Facebook to indicate a loading status, so instead of using ProgressBar or usual loader use Shimmer for a better design and user interface. They also open-sourced a library called Shimmer both for Android and iOS so that every developer could use it for free.
